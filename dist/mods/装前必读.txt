把压缩包内两个文件夹解压进换模工具即可

安装后可以去除镜头拉近和低角度下的虚化，水下的虚化暂时没解决

注意该模组是专用于4.2版本的，以后会更新

Genshin v4.2 Remove Transparency Filter

To install, put the folder from Mods inside your 3dmigoto GIMI Mods folder, and the files from ShaderFixes inside your 3dmigoto ShaderFixes folder (must not be nested for ShaderFixes! top level only)

No need to remove previous files when updating, though you can if you want - it won't make a difference either way. If you get prompted, say yes to override.

You may have to restart the game for the mod to take effect - sometimes F10 is not enough.

Previous versions (v3.0-v3.3, v3.4-3.5, v3.6-3.7, v3.8, v4.0, v4.1) are archived on gamebanana.
